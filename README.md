1. Improve graceful exits for errors during script execution.
2. Download files one by one in a priority queue.
3. Give the user control in the number of threads to be allocated.
4. Custom folder destination on all platforms.
5. Throttle the rate of downloading (maybe with regards to download speed)
6. Give support to the mainly used data formats found in the web (videos, photos, and audio or a mix of them)
7. Set option for downloading uncompressed or compressed files.
#### Secondary Priorities for future updates
1. Beautiful Command Line Interface (like Inquirer.js)
2. A Graphical User Interface standalone for it 
3. More support on other Unix-like operating systems
4. More support for other file formats
